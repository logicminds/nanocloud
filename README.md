Simple way to create dev environments using vagrant and puppet.

Notes: Since file permissions are not preserved you must issue the command: chmod 0660 vagrant



List of available boxes for download:  http://www.vagrantbox.es


Note: not all puppet configs work, as this is a WIP.

<pre><code>
	cd vagrantfiles
	cd nginx
	vagrant up
</code></pre>
